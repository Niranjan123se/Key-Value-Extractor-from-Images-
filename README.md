# Key-Value-Extractor-from-Images-
Dear Sir,

I am pleased to present the project I have developed: a Key-Value Extractor from Images. This project aims to automatically extract key-value pairs from images using advanced OCR and generative AI technologies.

Project Overview:
The Key-Value Extractor leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read text from images and uses a Generative AI (GenAI) model to process and extract relevant key-value pairs. The project is designed to handle various image types, ensuring accurate extraction of data for further processing or analysis.

Technical Specifications:
OCR Module:

Tool: Tesseract OCR (Pytesseract)
Function: Extracts text from images with high accuracy.
Generative AI (LLM) Module:

Model: Gemini-pro from Google Generative AI
Function: Processes extracted text and identifies key-value pairs based on user-defined keys.
Key Features:
Image Upload: Users can upload images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG formats.
Text Extraction: The OCR module extracts text from the uploaded images.
Key-Value Extraction: The generative AI module processes the extracted text and returns the key-value pairs in JSON format.
Error Handling: The system handles JSON decoding errors and provides meaningful error messages to the user.
Demonstration:
I have created a video demonstrating the functionality of the Key-Value Extractor, showcasing the process from image upload to key-value extraction. Please find the demonstration video attached to this email.

Code Repository:
The source code for this project is available on GitHub. You can access the repository using the following link: GitHub Repository



I am confident that this tool will be a valuable asset for automating data extraction tasks and improving efficiency. I look forward to any feedback or suggestions you may have.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Niranjan Kulkarni
